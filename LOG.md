# Execution Log

Written **only by Claude Code**, after something has actually been run.
Desktop reads this at the start of a session and never writes to it.

Format: date · what was run · the result · what was surprising.
Plans do not go here. Only what already happened.

## 2026-08-22 · `git init`

Ran `git init -b main` in `PoC/` and added a `.gitignore` (Python, `.env`,
editor noise, `.claude/settings.local.json`). Repository is empty — no commit
yet, the five `.md` files are untracked.

Surprising: nothing. The repo did not exist before today; `../archived/` and
`../doc/` sit outside it and are therefore not versioned by this repo.

## 2026-08-22 · NEXT item 1 — schema + deny triggers

Ran `docker compose up -d` (postgres:17, host port 5433) then
`psql -f kernel/001_schema.sql` inside the container. Exit 0. Three tables,
15 columns on `assertion`, three check constraints, six indexes,
`kernel_deny()` with BEFORE UPDATE/DELETE and BEFORE TRUNCATE triggers on all
three tables, `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE ... FROM PUBLIC`.

Ran `kernel/002_guard_test.sql`: inserted 1 intent + 2 entities + 1 assertion,
then UPDATE, DELETE and TRUNCATE on `assertion`. All three raised
`kernel is append-only: <OP> on assertion is not permitted`. The row still
reads `before`. Re-ran `001_schema.sql` a second time with data present —
exit 0, so the script is re-runnable.

Column list taken from `../archived/kernel-spec-source.md` §4, which is where
the closed 15-column list actually lives. Read only that section, only to
recover the closed list.

Surprising, three things:
- Docker Desktop had auto-updated at 04:25 and would not start; `wsl -l -v`
  reported no installed distributions. It came up on its own several minutes
  later, without intervention. Roughly 25 minutes lost to this.
- Git Bash rewrites `/kernel/001_schema.sql` into `C:/Program Files/Git/...`
  when passed through `docker exec`. Needs `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`.
- The spec puts guards in `002_guards.sql`, but the done condition requires
  one file, so guards live in `001_schema.sql`. `002_guard_test.sql` is the
  test, not the guards.

## 2026-08-22 · NEXT item 2 — minimal `perform()`

Created `.venv` and installed `psycopg[binary]` 3.3.4 (Python 3.12.10). Wrote
`kernel/perform.py`, 124 lines: one call writes one `intent`, mints N `entity`
rows and inserts N `assertion` rows inside a single `conn.transaction()`.
`mint` takes a list of labels and returns label -> uuid, so an assertion can
name its subject, predicate or `ref` by label instead of a uuid. No validation
beyond the check constraints — slot names are item 5.

`ontology_version` is the constant `"v0"` with a `# TODO` pointing at the open
T3. `subject_key_id` is inserted as NULL.

Ran `.venv/Scripts/python.exe scripts/write_three.py`: exit 0. One intent, five
entities, three assertions — seq 1..3, one `value_ref` row, two `value_literal`
rows, all `ontology_version='v0'`, all `subject_key_id=NULL`. `recorded_at` came
from the column default; identical to the microsecond across the three rows.

Also checked the gate is atomic: a second assertion with `source='not_a_source'`
raised `CheckViolation` on `source_known` and the intent count was unchanged, so
the whole call rolled back.

Surprising, two things:
- Predicates are entities, so nothing can be asserted before something mints
  the predicate. The demo mints five entities to write three assertions. That
  is the schema working as designed, but it means `perform()` cannot be called
  usefully without a minting step until the ontology exists.
- `psycopg` returns `timestamptz` as `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo('Etc/UTC')`, not
  `datetime.timezone.utc`. Equality still holds; identity comparisons will not.
